Acceptance test framework for the Kuali Sage project:
 * Confluence is the Feature editor, you write one feature per page and tag it with "acceptancetest"
 * Bumps pulls the Features into Cucumber and publishes junit xml report files 
   to be consumed with a Confluence {junit} macro on the page on which the Feature lives.
 * Browser automation using Culerity (should look into using Selenium on a headless server for better javascript support)

Notes on upgrade from Webrat driving Mechanize to Capybara driving Culerity driving Celerity driving HTMLUnit:
    1. Installed openjdk-6-jre-headless on the server
    2. jruby installed to /usr/local/jruby/bin
    3. added jruby path to PATH in my crontab and my own path
    4. add paths for command line tools jruby needs such as uname, tr, basename, dirname, and, of course, java
    4. jruby -S gem install celerity
    5. sudo gem install culerity
    6. sudo gem install capybara
