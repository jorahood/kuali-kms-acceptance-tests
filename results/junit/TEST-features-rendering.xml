Scenario: I can render a specialized doc that doesn't reference any other documents

Given I am logged in as "editor1"
Given a document with filename "bbah.dita" exists with content

When I preview the document with audience filter "default"
Then I should see "You need to run the xslt transformation" in the preview window
