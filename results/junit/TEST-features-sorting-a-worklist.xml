Scenario: Setting a default sort order for one column

Given I am logged in as "editor1"
And the following documents exist with metadata:
And a new worklist
And the worklist contains the following documents:
And the worklist displays the author column
And I sort the worklist by author
And I set this sort order as default
When I sort the worklist by content id
And I reload the worklist
Then the worklist should be sorted by author

Message:
expected there to be content "Author" in "   " (RSpec::Expectations::ExpectationNotMetError) (RSpec::Expectations::ExpectationNotMetError)
