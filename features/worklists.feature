Feature: Worklists

In order to handle projects that require editing an ad hoc group of documents
As a KB Maintainer
I want the system to incorporate docs into lists that I can interact with

Scenario: Creating a new worklist is an option

Given I am logged in as "editor1"
Then I should see "New worklist"
